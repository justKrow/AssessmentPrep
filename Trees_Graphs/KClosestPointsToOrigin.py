# ðŸ§© Problem: K Closest Points to Origin
# Prompt:

# You are given an array of points where points[i] = [xáµ¢, yáµ¢] represents a point on the X-Y plane, and an integer k.

# Return the k closest points to the origin(0, 0).

# The distance between a point (x, y) and the origin is:
# sqrt(xÂ² + yÂ²)
# But we can avoid the square root for comparison purposes (since sqrt is monotonic).
