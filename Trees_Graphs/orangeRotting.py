#  BFS Approach (Optimal, Clean, Interviewable)
# This is multi-source BFS:

# Think of all initial rotten oranges as level 0 of BFS

# In each minute, rot adjacent fresh ones â†’ they go to next level

# Continue until there are no fresh oranges left
# grid = [
#   [2, 1, 1],
#   [1, 1, 0],
#   [0, 1, 1]
# ]
