# Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement

# Prompt:
# You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character in the string and replace it with any other uppercase English letter, at most k times.

# Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the operation at most k times.

# Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the one 'B' in "AABA**B**BA" with 'A' â†’ "AAAA", length 4.

        if window_size - max_freq > k:
            count[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
